There is a race condition where a player can join a game and tries to join another game after the condition is checked. Allowing a player to briefly join two games. This edge and rare case could be solved by:
        - Defining an SLA (?)
        - Having a separate process that checks whether an user has two games and doing some compensation
        - Decoupling the request event from the actual joining to a game. Allowing some time to catch on. Or by sending the id of the last event used to perform the check? */
